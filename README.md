# FAQ ‚ö°

What does our program do?

I removes all human error when it comes to holding angles, never miss again

Can I get Banned?

Yes, but it is very uncommon, the Anti-cheat can't ban you but if you're mass reported and there are someone screenshots of your GUI you can get banned. Just do not hold pixel corners that no-one could ever do

What is the difference between hold mode and Constant mode?

Hold mode means the bot will only shoot holding your designated key, constant mode is
 always looking for the Outline. Sometimes in maps there are the same colors as the 
 outline and sometimes with constant mode it will randomly shoot.
 
why is it not working?

make sure you have the outline the same as the target color or wou may need to run the program as admin

Video Mode: Windowed Full Screen (Not Full Screen)

RAW INPUT BUFFER: OFF

Why does my computer think its malware?
Our Script looks for the outline on your screen and your PC doesn't want programs to do 
that and when running it also looks for keypresses

OP and Marshal are not working?
Make sure your skin doesn't make the scope dot the same color as the outline
make sure you are using 3 boxsize or higher
